# suicide-rate-data-analysis
The goal of this project was to create a graphical representation of average suicide rates in females aged 15-24 over time. (Note that the word 
"females" is used because I am unsure as to whether the source statistics include all women or consider only biological sex). 

This was a project I completed for a python-based programming course. 
It was inspired by my passion for mental health, as well as a curiousity about how suicide rates have (or have not) changed since the introduction of social media.

The data was pulled from an open-source CSV, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016
